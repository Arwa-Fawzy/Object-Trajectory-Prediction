# Object-Trajectory-Prediction
The color finder in OpenCV with HSV values could highlight the targeted object, the ball, among the rest of objects. This aided to assign the location of ball's center point in (x,y) coordinates and was saved to be connected. Accordingly, the polynomial curve of its motion in future was predicted, and this could be a turning point for creating a flying hoop.
